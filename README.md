# Machine Learning for Portfolio Weights Optimization

Will artificial intelligence revolutionize the way we invest? 

My thesis exposes the possibility of the effective use of machine learning algorithms to address one of the most complex challenges faced by investors: optimizing a financial portfolio.

Modern Portfolio Theory provided the foundation for addressing the issue of balancing risk and return in a portfolio, which is necessary to achieve high performance. 

The advent of big data and new advances in artificial intelligence also introduce new opportunities to radically transform asset allocation methodologies within an investment portfolio. Risk management and portfolio management operations, previously performed by humans, are gradually being entrusted to automated algorithms.

In my study, I wanted to investigate the implementation of machine learning algorithms for optimizing the weights to be assigned to the financial instruments that make up a portfolio. To evaluate the results obtained, I compared the performance of portfolios constructed using machine learning techniques with the performance of an equal-weighted portfolio consisting of the same financial instruments.
